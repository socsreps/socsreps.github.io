      Hi! This is Nick and Zuzy, and the two of us are course reps for Computer Science and Games Computing respectively. The other 2 Second year course reps, Brandon and Reece, have been course reps the previous year so you might already know them very well, but the two of us have decided that we wanted to introduce ourselves and tell you why we decided to apply and become course reps in a little more detail than our manifestos would allow. Hopefully this will give you a chance to get to know us better.

        Hey, I&apos;m Nick and I&apos;m one of the Course Reps for Computer Science this year. I decided to be a Rep because I wanted to make a difference, I wanted to leave some mark on the University Experience at Lincoln. I enjoyed my first year but there were some things that were a bit rough around the edges and somethings could have been a lot smoother, this is what I wanted to help to fix. I knew that not everybody might have had the same experience as me and I wanted to fix that as well. Being a Rep meant that I had to work with the Lectures and Staff to make the content they are delivering as understandable to that students as possible. But also meant that I need to work with the students to see if they need any assistance with the content. I know I need to be this intermediary between the staff and the students so that each side knows what the other is experiencing and work things out between them.

        Hi! I&apos;m Zuzy and I will be one of your course reps for Games Computing in the Second year, along with Reece. Nick and I Had applied for Course rep together, albeit for our 2 different courses of Computer Science and Games Computing. We both had amazing experiences in the first year, but there had been things here and there that could have gone better or had been smoother. We talked to the then Course reps and enjoyed how they took everyone&apos;s words into consideration and listened to any ideas that came their way. I found that to be a position I wished to find myself in, one to help my friends and fellow students with issues that they have, no matter how small. I believe every voice should be heard, and every idea put to the table. Becoming a rep seemed to be the perfect idea, but I only realised that after I became friends with the first-year reps. That meant that, once the nominations opened, I put myself forwards as a second-year rep the second I could. I am very proud of the SoCS community and I wish to better it in any way though the voice of the Second year Games Computing students. I am hopeful you will reach out to me and Reece with any issues that arise, no matter how small. You can email me at any time or find me on the CSS Discord.
        I wish Everyone the very best for the next academic year.
