  <h4>By Garry Clawson</h4> 

  <h5 style="color:grey">June 29, 2021</h5> 

    <p>One of the biggest barriers that women in STEM are facing is being the only women in the room. At the University of Lincoln, on courses such as Computer Science, female students only make up 7%-8% of the cohort. This not only skews the experience for everyone, but shows how much work there is still to do.<p>

    <p>An amazing group of women STEM students designed three separately themed roundtables to discuss head on, why this is and what can be done about it. These roundtables are student led, open and honest discussions about what it is to be a student woman in science. We are sure you will enjoy watching them as much as we did making them. We also hope it creates as much discussion.</p>

    <p>To start, we asked the fantastic year 2 Computer Science student, Emma Baskerville, to give a brief explanation as to why she wanted to be part of the student led Women In Science roundtables.

    <h4>Roundtable 1 - Pre University and Outreach:</h4> 

    <p>The first roundtable is focused upon pre-university and outreach. In many instances, a student&apos;s journey into STEM does not start at 18 or when they cross the threshold of a university campus. In the first session we explored what outreach students had and the visibility of women ambassadors when deciding upon a university. We also spoke about how events, such as open days, or online virtual events, guided opinions on how students felt they would fit into the school.</p>

    <h4>Roundtable 2 - University Literature and Prospectus:</h4> 

    <p>The second roundtable reviewed the current University literature and prospectus. This is often the first contact a potential student has with the University and sets the tone going forwards. We asked whether the literature was useful for the perception of the course, who was its intended audience and how was it communicated. We also discussed how it compared to other courses within the college of science.</p>

    <h4>Roundtable 3 - Course Design and Student Experience:</h4> 

    <p>The third and final roundtable covered the current course design and experience students are having today. Many students will speak to friends or old school mates about what their experiences are like. We discussed course design and engagement opportunities. We also asked if there was enough visibility around role models and how areas such as mentoring could be improved.</p>
